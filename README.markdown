# Soul Speed Minecart

High-speed rail in Minecraft using the mysterious power of soul soil.

This is a datapack for Minecraft 1.21 or later. With this pack installed
minecarts with player passengers will travel at high speeds when travelling on
rails over soul soil. The top speed is a bit faster than riding a boat over ice.

Rails placed on soul soil must be straight and level. You may use any type of
rail.

You will need powered rails to get up to speed before the soul speed effect
takes over - up to five powered rails might be required. You will know it's
working when you see soul speed particles. Then it takes a few seconds to
accelerate to full speed.

Once you are moving at high speed you do not need powered rails to maintain
speed as long as the cart stays on soul soil.

Beware of corners! Changes in direction or sudden stops at excessive speed can
be dangerous! Elevation change is not recommended at high speed.

From full speed you will need 8 blocks to slow down before a turn or a stop.
Make sure to have straight, level rails of any type along the full slowdown
distance. Powered rails will work to slow down safely, even if they are powered.

## Installation

Run,

```sh
$ make
```

or create a zip file containing the files inside the `datapack/` directory (not
including the `datapack/` directory itself.)

Then copy `soulcart.zip` to a folder named `datapacks` in your world save.
